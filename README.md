# CTF Writeups

A collection of Capture The Flag challenge writeups documenting my approach to solving security challenges across multiple domains. Each writeup covers the attack methodology, the underlying vulnerability, and defensive mitigations — because understanding both sides is what separates a security professional from a script kiddie.

## Writeups by Category

### Web Exploitation

| Challenge | Difficulty | Points | Description |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| [SQL Injection: Login Bypass](web/sql-injection-login-bypass.md) | Medium | 200 | Exploiting a login form via SQL injection |
| [XSS: Stored Cross-Site Scripting](web/xss-cookie-theft.md) | Medium | 250 | Cookie theft through stored XSS in a comment form |

### Cryptography

| Challenge | Difficulty | Points | Description |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| [RSA: Small Public Exponent Attack](crypto/rsa-small-exponent.md) | Hard | 300 | Exploiting RSA with e=3 via cube root attack |
| [Hash Length Extension Attack](crypto/hash-length-extension.md) | Hard | 350 | Forging MACs against naive H(secret \|\| message) construction |

### Network Forensics

| Challenge | Difficulty | Points | Description |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| [Network Forensics: Hidden in Plain Sight](network/packet-analysis.md) | Easy | 150 | Extracting credentials from unencrypted network traffic |

### Digital Forensics

| Challenge | Difficulty | Points | Description |
